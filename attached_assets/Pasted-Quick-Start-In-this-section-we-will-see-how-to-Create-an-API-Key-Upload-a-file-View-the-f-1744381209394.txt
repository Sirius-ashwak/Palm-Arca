Quick Start
In this section, we will see how to

Create an API Key

Upload a file

View the file

Get Filecoin deals

Verify a Filecoin deal

This guidance is in Nodejs, but in case you are using any other language, refer to the how-to section to get APIs that can be called directly.

Create an API Key

1. Login into Lighthouse files dapp (https://files.lighthouse.storage/)
2. Go to the API key section and generate the key

You can also generate the API key from CLI


Upload File

1. Install the lighthouse package in your Node application
2. Run the following script

Copy
import lighthouse from '@lighthouse-web3/sdk'

const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
const uploadResponse = await lighthouse.upload(
  '/home/cosmos/Desktop/wow.jpg', 
  apiKey
);

console.log(uploadResponse);
You will get a response like this once file is successfully uploaded:

Copy
{
  data: {
    Name: 'wow.jpg',
    Hash: 'QmUHDKv3NNL1mrg4NTW4WwJqetzwZbGNitdjr2G6Z5Xe6s',
    Size: '31735'
  }
}
View File

The file can be viewed from an IPFS gateway
https://gateway.lighthouse.storage/ipfs/QmWC9AkGa6vSbR4yizoJrFMfmZh4XjZXxvRDknk2LdJff

Get Filecoin Deal

The Filecoin deal can take up to 2 days to show up once the file is uploaded. To get Filecoin deal use the following function of the SDK

Copy
const status = await lighthouse.dealStatus('bafkreia4ruswe7ghckleh3lmpujo5asrnd7hrtu5r23zjk2robpcoend34')
The response will look like this

Copy
data: [
    {
        "endEpoch": 4490732,
        "chainDealID": 45796363,

        "miner": "f02620",
        "content": 31721
    }
]
Verify Filecoin Deal

Lighthouse aggregates files uploaded by multiple users into a 32GB CAR file and stores this CAR with a storage provider. To verify that your file was part of the Filecoin deal, you can use the PODSI verification. Refer to the Filecoin Virtual Machine section for more details.
